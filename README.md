This repository contains data and codes to reproduce results of the conference paper titled "Feature subset selection using sparse principal component analysis and multiclass classification using selected features". The paper has been accpted for the conference. 

Codes are written in R and we have run it on R-3.5.3. The code will save some figures and tables in local directory. Some of those figures have been used in the paper.

For other reproducible results on condition monitoring, readers can visit [my project page](https://biswajitsahoo1111.github.io/project/personal-project/) on my [personal website](https://biswajitsahoo1111.github.io/).
